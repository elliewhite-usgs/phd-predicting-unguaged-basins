The choice of a loss function is the translation of an informal philosophical objective into mathematics (Hennig & Kutlukaya, 2007). This choice can be somewhat subjective and depends on the specific application or decisions being made with model results. Some loss functions have already been established and are common in hydrology. 

The dissertation chapter four will look at differences in performance of these functions when they are embedded in the machine learning algorithm rather than using them as only an evaluation step after the model is built.

Try different loss functions including weighted assymetric mean squared error, with different weights, and compare.
