This research is to develop statistical models, generally simpler than mechanistic models, that use statistical learning techniques to predict the unimpaired flows of California basins from available data. 

These models are simply made with the data. I start with very simple models and later develop more complex machine learning and deep learning models. No testing or validation is done here (for that, see pub-resampling).
