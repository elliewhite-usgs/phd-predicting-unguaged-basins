This research is to develop statistical models, generally simpler than mechanistic models, that use statistical learning techniques to predict the unimpaired flows of California basins from available data. 

The model focuses on predicting flows from ungauged basins, an International Association of Hydrological Sciences "grand challenge" in hydrology. 

In the past two decades, more sophisticated statistical learning models have been applied to rainfall-runoff modeling. In juxtaposition with physical or semi-physical models, machine learning models learn from the data itself, with no assumptions on the underlying process.
