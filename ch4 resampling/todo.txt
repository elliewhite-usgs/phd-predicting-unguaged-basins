To Do: 

IMPORTANT, check that inc basins make sense, because if basins above are nested, you may be subtracting two datasets instead of the one!!!! for example, check with KRB, KRK, KRI basins


1) why is lmc_inc not working for logo, something with DOMGEOLOGY is messing it up
2) post process the inc back to agg and the cumulative back to non-cumulative values. Then compare the gofs
