Most prior studies apply only one statistical learning method. This fails to acknowledge that if a statistical learning method works well for one data set, it may be that the problem was defined in a space rich with solutions and potentially near-optimal results (Winston, 2010). That is, other statistical learning methods might also produce good and potentially different results. Therefore, the seeming merits of the statistical learning method might be due to the problem's characteristics. Of course, the researcher may apply other statistical learning methods. 

The dissertation chapter three presents a guide for finding suitable statistical methods, particularly in supervised machine learning. As a heuristic guide, it will work well for many problems, but may fail to recommend a good method in other cases.
